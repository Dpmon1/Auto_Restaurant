## Automate your restaurant!

Most restaurants have leftover food by the day’s end, and sometimes there are menu items that have not been ordered even once throughout the day. The Green Restaurant Association found that the average restaurant may produce up to 100,000 pounds of food waste in a year. Ingredients that could have been consumed are instead disposed of because they expire. This results in most of the food waste ending up in landfills, where it rots or ferments into greenhouse gases. Additionally, this wastage also contributes to the proliferation of chemicals or undesirable bacteria that are a danger to public health and the environment if left unchecked. The food waste also represents lost revenue. Money that could have been spent to make revenue-generating dishes is instead spent on unused ingredients for less popular dishes. It is even possible that state regulations issue fines for food waste violations.

Furthermore, items that are less popular are often kept on a restaurant’s menu, resulting in funds being wasted on buying ingredients for these items. These funds could have been instead allocated to ingredients for more popular items. An application that could automatically identify these less popular items would be desirable. 

Another problem: there tends to be a disconnect between customers and restaurants on what dishes are available, especially when dining in. A method of being able to convey this information almost instantaneously would help streamline the link between customer, restaurant, and menu item so that the customer will not get their hopes up on ordering something that is unavailable.

All these issues could be avoided if there was proper analysis of the restaurant’s clientele and the market for ingredients. This can be easily done by a computer with simple sorting algorithms and the use of a database, and then graphed to help the manager make better informed choices
